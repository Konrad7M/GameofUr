  A game for 2 players, similar to backgammon.
  The objective of the game is to lead 7 stones through the board as in the attached picture.
Overy turn starts with pushing the triangular dice, its color indicates the current player while the number is the distance a stone can travel. Upon pushing the dice any stone on board can be selected to move including those off board (the capital "s" fields). 
  Two stones of the same color cannot be in the same field. Placing a stone ona field occupied by the other player removes the opponents stone from the board and sets it back to the begining. 
  There are special fields (with the violet flowers) 
that give the player an additional dice role. Any stone can be selected in this situation as well.
